<h3>Scared...</h3>
<p>If you are American, you probably know that donald trump has done bad stuff in the past 30 days. First, he appointed Scott Pruitt as his EPA Administrator. This guy is a climate change denier from a freak show planet. Then he signed a bill to deny refugee entry for 120 days, banned citizens of Muslim Majority contries from entering the United States, and suspened Syrian refugee entry forever! This guy allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to continue, angering Native Tribes of the  Sioux people and causing mass enviromental destruction! <br><br>
But enough of that talk, Donald Trump will erode our privacy. Our packets will pass through large collection swaths as it traverses the internet. And that's coming from a guy who once said "Boycott all Apple products until such time as Apple gives cellphone info to authorities regarding radical Islamic terrorist couple from Cal" - December 19 2016. As president, he controls the NSA, and wants the survellience to continue. But we can change that. By making internet encryption a universal standerd, we can end survellience without any govermental action. The Goverment can't do anything now, so we will have to change. And someday, survellence will cease to exist.
